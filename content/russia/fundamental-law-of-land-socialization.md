This will obtain until a general decree is promulgated concerning the insurance of citizens unable to work.

Article 9. The distribution of agricultural land among the toilers is in the hands of the land departments of the village, volost, uezd, gubernia, regional, and federal Soviets.

Article 10. Tile administration of the land reserve in each republic is in the hands of the main land departments [of the republics] and the federal Soviet.

    * In the first place, the land will be given to local agriculturists who have little or no land, and to hired farm laborers. The land is to be distributed in equal shares.
    * In the second place, it will be given to newcomers, i.e., agriculturists who arrive at a given locality after the publication of this law.
    * In the third place, it will be given to non-agricultural elements in the order in which they are registered by the land department of the local Soviets.
        * Note: In making the allotments of land, preference will be given to agricultural associations over individual farmers.

[Article 23 deals with the allotment of garden land; 24 with land going under buildings.]

### PART IV. THE CONSUMPTION-LABOR STANDARD

Article 25. The area of land allotted to individual farms to furnish tile means of subsistence must not exceed the limits of the consumption-labor standard, which is to be calculated on the basis of the following instructions:

##### INSTRUCTIONS FOR DETERMINING THE CONSUMPTION-LABOR STANDARD

1. Agricultural Russia is to be divided into as many zones as there are different systems of land cultivation (farm-fallow system, three-field system, eight-field system, many-field system, rotation of crops, etc.) in practice at the present time.
2. Each zone is to have its own standard, which, however, may vary in accordance with conditions of climate, natural fertility of the soil, and marketing facilities.
3. In order to determine the standard for each zone, an All-Russian agricultural census will be taken in the near future.
    * Note: Immediately after putting this law into force the land will be surveyed and topographic maps made.
4. [The distribution of land will take place gradually.]
5. In determining the consumption-Iabor standard for a given zone the average farm of the least thickly populated uezd will be taken as 'a basis .... . The uezd in question must be characterized by such a relation between the different branches of agriculture as is judged by the local population to be most normal, i.e., most favorable for carrying on tile type of agriculture dominant in the given zone.
6. In determining the average peasant farm as it exists today, only those lands will be taken into consideration which the peasants actually cultivated prior to 1917, that is to say, the lands bought and rented by peasant societies and individuals.
7. Forests, minerals, and waters are not to be included in this calculation.
8. Neither will there be taken into account those privately owned lands which were under capitalistic cultivation or those which tip to now belonged to the state, private banks, monasteries, udel, or pomeshchiks (cabinet and church) ; these lands will constitute a land reserve out of which allotments will be made to peasants who have no land or whose shares fall below the existing consumption-Iabor standard.
    * [Points nine to thirteen set forth rules for the calculation of the total amount of land available for distribution.]
14. In taking the population census the number of workers and the number of consumers [literally "bread-eaters"] will be calculated separately. The whole population is to be classified in respect to age as follows:

##### HAVING NO CAPACITY TO WORK
Girls to 12 years of age
Boys to 12 years of age
Men from 60 years of age
Women from 50 years of age

##### CAPABLE OF WORK

|     |Age  |Worker Units|
|-----|-----|------------|
|Men  |18-60|1.0         |
|Women|18-5O|0.8         |
|Boys |12-16|0.5         |
|Girls|12-16|0.5         |
|Boys |16-18|0.75        |
|Girls|16-18|0.6         |

Note: These figures may be changed in accordance with climatic conditions and local customs by decision of the appropriate organs of tile Soviet Government.

15. The amount of land per worker unit may be determined by dividing the number of desiatins by the number of worker units.
16. The number of dependents to be provided for by one worker unit may be obtained by dividing the number of non-workers by the number of "worker units."
17. It is further necessary to make an estimate of the number of cattle which can be fed on a desiatin and by one working unit.
18. In order to determine the average size of a farm in a uezd, which may be taken as typical for a given zone, the average fertility and quality of a desiatin must be ascertained. This average will be found by dividing tile total crop .... by the number of types of soil.
19. The average thus found will be taken as the point of departure in determining the consumption-labor standard in accordance with which the equalization of all farms is to take place.
    * Note: In case the above average proves insufficient for a satisfactory standard of living it may be increased out of the land reserve.
20. The amount of land .... required for additional allotments by those whose shares fall below the normal average may be determined by multiplying the amount of land which goes to one "worker unit" in a particular uezd by the total number of worker units of that zone and subtracting from the result the number of desiatins in actual possession of the peasants.
21. Then the land reserve fund .... should be compared with the amount of land required for additional allotments ill order to ascertain whether migration can take place within the zone in question .... In case this is impossible [it is necessary to find out] how many families will have to move to another zone.
